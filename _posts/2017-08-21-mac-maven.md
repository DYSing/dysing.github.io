# Mac OS X 安装Maven:

* 下载 [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), 并解压到某个目录。例如/Users/Runtime/apache-maven-3.5.0

### System Requirements
```
Java Development Kit (JDK)	Maven 3.3+ require JDK 1.7 or above to execute - they still allows you to build against 1.3 and other JDK versions by Using Toolchains
```
```
Memory	No minimum requirement
```
```
Disk	Approximately 10MB is required for the Maven installation itself. In addition to that, additional disk space will be used for your local Maven repository. The size of your local repository will vary depending on usage but expect at least 500MB.
```
```
Operating System	No minimum requirement. Start up scripts are included as shell scripts and Windows batch files.
```

* 打开`Terminal`,输入以下命令，设置`Maven classpath`

`$ vi ~/.bash_profile`

* 添加下列两行代码，之后保存并退出`Vi`：

```
export M2_HOME=/Users/Runtime/apache-maven-3.5.0 
export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin
```

* 输入命令以使`bash_profile`生效

```
 $ source ~/.bash_profile
```

* 输入`mvn -v`查看Maven是否安装成功
